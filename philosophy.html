                <p>I use Sublime Text these days. It's a very powerful text editor (of which there are impressively many) that doesn't seek to be a full IDE. There's a certain elegance to simple coding programs that you can easily take advantage of when you're working as a web developer. No compile cycles makes for rapid revision and makes agile programmers squee with pleasure. It also simplifies debugging.

                Lower level code is a different beast, although steady improvements to languages and tools have made it more approachable. As a primarily high-level, front-end oriented engineer, I miss out on some of the optimization CPU and OS designers have brought to the field (although, yet again, disciplines exist to bring Javascript closer to metal). On the other hand, squeezing every drop of performance and reliability out of a block of Javascript requires a very similar skillset. The way I like to share my code, though, I also have to pay attention to readability and design time; these are questions every programmer runs into, and I expect to develop my solutions to them as my career advances.

            <p>So many artists these days value brevity and minimalism. They have a point.
            <br><br>
            While I find it doesn't really suit my style as a musician, I find simple, clean, legible visual design satisfying and always seek to achieve that ideal in my own work. I'm self-taught as a graphical designer (and I consider myself more of a programmer anyways), so that used to be all I could do. In recent years, I've become better at coming up with these designs for myself, partially because the tools I use have improved.
            <br><br>
            When I'm in the employ of another, I find the end result is more about what they want. That is one of those obvious points that you don't really think about because it seems obvious, but it's good practice to dredge up the fundamentals of your business for meditation once in a while. Less obviously, I find that opening myself up to the ideas of others often helps me get a better perspective on my own, and in the long term leads to better implementations.
